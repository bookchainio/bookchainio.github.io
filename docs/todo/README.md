# TODO

[Task list](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/todo/task-list) is the folder that contain tasks tranformed from [strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies) with the [process strategy principles](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/process-strategy-principles.md).

[Process strategy principles](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/process-strategy-principles.md) is also used to process tasks optimally.

Will be soon deleted and replaced by GitHub issues containing `todo` label.
