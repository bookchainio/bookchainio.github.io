# Strategy planner

## Introduction

An optimal strategy is a strategy that take less effort accomplish an objective.

* Strategy must be realist and composed of directives that can be nested.
 * A directive = a process line resumed in a composition of words.
* Directives must be optimally allocated within the trajectory to suitably achieve an objective.
 * Optimally allocated = not too much directives to loose cost re-planning because of unknown events and too less to loose cost asking too much what is this fuck.

## Principles

Principles are tools to efficiently define strategies.

* Strategy must be clear, simple and up-to-date.
* Strategy provide solid lines, thus draw an exact status of where things stand.
* Think freshly from scratch knowing actual parameters that matter for objective.
* Think the simplest way with a cost-conscious mindset to accomplish objective.
* Know what is optimal and what is not.
* Focus on sustainable cost management, cost reduction and investment.
* Feed-back strategy optimization and check if it is realistic.
* When strategy obstacles occurs there are gifts to perfect it.
