# Projects

Projects are the 3rd organization layer translated from mixed strategies parts. They are a composition of shorts strategies, tasks, discussion and more in order to achieve one or more sub-strategy and grouped by output type.

They are linked with [GitHub projects](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/projects) and [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/milestones).

They planned and converted into [tasks](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/labels/todo) with the [plan strategy principle](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/plan-strategy-principles.md) and processed with the [process strategy principles](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/process-strategy-principles.md).
