# Work the system (methodology)

This document describe the document set used to work the primary **ESTEEM8 system**.

### Introduction
```
A system is what make it does what it perform.
```

### Vocabulary
* **A system** is a composition of nested systems composed of functions.
* **A function** is a composition of process grouped by a type.
* **A process** is a series of mechanical or chemical operations.

### Definitions are the what

* [/definiton](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/definition)
 * [System definition](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-definition.md) what is the current system ?
 * [System objectives](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-objectives.md) what is it's objectives ?

### Strategies are the how

 * [/strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies)
  * [/optimization strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies/optimization-strategies) how will it optimize it's current state ?
  * [/development strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies/development-strategies) how will it develop it's current state ?

### Principles are how of "how and what"
 
 * [/tools](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/tools)
  * [Make strategy principles](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/make-strategy-principles.md) how to make strategies ?
  * [Process strategy principles](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/process-strategy-principles.md) how to apply strategies ?

## What the fuck ?

* [Objectives](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-objectives.md) are made for a very long term planning.
* [Strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies) are made for a long term planning and translated from objectives grouped by objectives.
* [Projects](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/projects) are made for a middle term planning from mixed strategy parts grouped by work type and strategies.
* [Tasks](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/issues) are made for a short term planning from mixed projects parts grouped by work type.

These point above are organized from high level to low level, more the level is low, more the process description is precise.

Organization principles are tools to write a textual process description also called strategy. Efficiency principles are tools to translate these textual representation of process into real mechanical and biological process.

As high the textual process representation level is, as much it's representation is grouped by objectives and as low the process textual representation level is, as much it's representation is grouped by process skills or type. This in order to minimize effort switching subject (objective) for a planning process and minimizing effort switching skills for a processing process process. 

[Make strategy principles](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/make-strategy-principles.md) is used to plan optimal optimization & development [strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies).

 [System definition](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-definition.md) is used to plan [optimization strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies/optimization-strategies) in order to optimze actual systems and interactions to improve the system composition efficiency.

 [System objectives](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-objectives.md) is used to plan [development strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies/development-strategies) in order to add new systems and interactions to reach the system's objectives.

[Process strategy principles](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/process-strategy-principles.md) is used to efficiently transform optimization and development [strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies) parts into [todo/projects](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/todo/projects). Projects are then transformed into "Issues" using the project milestone name and the label "task".
