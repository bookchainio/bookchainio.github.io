# Work the system (methodology)

This document describe the document set used to work the primary **ESTEEM8 system**.

## Introduction

What is a system ?
```
A system is what make it does what it perform.
```

#### Vocabulary
* **A system** is a composition of nested systems composed of _functions_ grouped by objective.
* **A function** is a composition of _process_ grouped by a type.
* **A process** is a series of _mechanical and chemical operations_ composed of nested process grouped by task type.

## Composition

### The what

* [/definiton](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/definition)
 * [System definition](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-definition.md) what is the current system ?
 * [System objectives](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-objectives.md) what is it's objectives ?

### The how

 * [/strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies)
  * [/optimization strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies/optimization-strategies) how will it optimize it's current state ?
  * [/development strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies/development-strategies) how will it develop it's current state ?

### The how of "what + how"
 
 * [/tools](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/tools)
  * [Organization principles](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/make-strategy-principles.md) how to make strategies ?
  * [Process principles](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/process-strategy-principles.md) how to apply strategies ?
  
## Explanations

### Organization level

* [Objectives](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-objectives.md) are made for a very long term planning.
* [Strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies) are made for a long term planning and translated from objectives grouped by objectives.
* [Projects](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/projects) are made for a middle term planning from mixed strategy parts grouped by work type and strategies.
* [Tasks](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/issues) are made for a short term planning from mixed projects parts grouped by work type.

### Composition interactions

* These 4 point above are organization and sorted from high level to low level.
  * High level -> lowly precise process description, morely grouped by objective and plan type.
  * Low level -> highly precise process description, morely grouped by skills and process type.
* Organization principles are tools to write and precise these process descriptions also called strategies.
* Process principles are tools to translate process descriptions into mechanical and biological process.

--

* System definition -> Optimization strategies
* System objectives -> Development strategies
* Definition & Objectives -> Strategies -> Projects -> Tasks [Definition and conversion made using organization principles]
* Tasks -> mechanical and biological process [Conversion made using process principles]

**Esteem8 projects** are [GitHub projects](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/projects) and the associated [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/milestones) (By name)

**Esteem8 tasks** are [GitHub issues](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/issues) that can be filtered by label(Skills type) and projects(milestone).
