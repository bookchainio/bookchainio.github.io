# Work the system methodology

This document describe the document set used to work the primary **ESTEEM8 system**.

## Introduction

```
A system is what make it does what it perform.
```

#### Vocabulary
* **A system** is a composition of nested systems composed of _functions_ grouped by objective.
* **A function** is a composition of _process_ grouped by a type.
* **A process** is a series of _mechanical and chemical operations_ composed of nested process grouped by task type.

## Composition
### The what

* [/definiton](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/definition)
 * [System definition](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-definition.md) what is the current system ?
 * [System objectives](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-objectives.md) what is it's objectives ?

### The how

 * [/strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies)
  * [/optimization strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies/optimization-strategies) how will it optimize it's current state ?
  * [/development strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies/development-strategies) how will it develop it's current state ?

### The how of "what + how"
 
 * [/tools](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/tools)
  * [Organization principles](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/make-strategy-principles.md) how to make strategies ?
  * [Process principles](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/tools/process-strategy-principles.md) how to apply strategies ?
  
## Explanations
### Organization level

* [Objectives](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-objectives.md) are made for a very long term planning.
* [Strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies) are made for a long term planning and translated from objectives grouped by objectives.
* [Projects](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/projects) are made for a middle term planning from mixed strategy parts grouped by work type and strategies.
* [Tasks](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/issues) are made for a short term planning from mixed projects parts grouped by work type.

### Organization level (precision)

* These 4 point above are organizational (process description) and sorted from a high level to a low level.
  * High level -> lowly precise process description, morely grouped by objective and plan type.
  * Low level -> highly precise process description, morely grouped by skills and process type.
* Organization principles are tools to write and precise these process descriptions also called objectives, strategies, projects and tasks.
* Process principles are tools to translate process descriptions into mechanical and biological process.

#### Using "Organization principles" doc

* [**What ?**](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/definition) (**Definition of** composition & objectives ) ->

* [**How ?**](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies) (**Strategie to** optimize composition & reach objectives) ->

* **Projects** ([GitHub projects](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/projects) & [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/milestones) (with the same name)) ->

* **Tasks** ([GitHub issues](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/issues) filtered and sorted by label(=skills) & milestone(=projects)).

#### Using "Process principles" doc

* **Tasks** -> Mechanical and biological process (Your job)
