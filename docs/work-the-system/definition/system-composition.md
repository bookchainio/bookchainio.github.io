# ESTEEM8 System composition
This is an overview of the whole ES8 system composition.

This schema will be splited into a first low-detailed schema with primary systems and interactions and some other with the details of these primary systems.

![Alt text](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/ESTEEM8%20System%20overview.png?raw=true "ESTEEM8 System composition")

Schema made with [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

Shemas are composed of unlimited nested systems and interactions.

For each of these systems and interactions, a specific strategy will be made in order to seperately optimize each systems and interactions that compose the primary system called "ESTEEM8".

Theses strategy will be placed into the [optimization-strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies/optimization-strategies) folder.

## Example

For "Add app users" systems and interactions a strategy will be made the way above:

1. Add app user [1] -> Optimze convertion rate between STEEM (publications) users and the APP users :
 * Optimize the way that publications are posted : STEEM publications visitor -> APP STEEM publications visitor.
 * Optimize the content of publications : APP STEEM publications visitor -> APP visitor.
 * Optmize the content of the APP : APP visitor -> APP users.
 * Optmize the application quality: APP users -> APP active users.
 * Get feedback and analysis about these systems and refine and optimize it again and again.
 
2. Add app user [2] -> ...

-

"->" = optimaly tranform = get the best convertion rate.
