![Alt text](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/schema/system-overview.png "ESTEEM8 System composition")

The schema was made on [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

Shemas are composed of systems and interactions.

For each of these components a strategy will be made in order to optimize the ESTEEM8 system.
Theses strategy will be placed into the "optimization-strategies" folder.
