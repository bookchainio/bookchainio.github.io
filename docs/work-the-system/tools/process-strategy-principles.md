# Process strategy principles

This is a tool to optimally transform mixed strategy parts into process (actions or tasks).

## Introduction

Before starting to work **choose optimal (best) strategy parts** you want to work on, detail them into sub-process (tasks) and then timely organize them.

During the work time **process sub-process chosen efficiently** by being in good body and mind conditions.

## Organization principles
* Choose directive parts that is optimal to work on for the workday.
* To optimally choose what to work on use these principles above:
 * See thing with a cost-conscious driven mindset to minimize effort.
 * Do efficiency improvement process first to maximize exchange rate.
 * You can increase motivation by knowing doing actual optimal task to achieve the defined objective.
 * First things first by urgency then importance with knowing strategies deadlines.
* Directive parts chosen must be optimally transformed into sub-process that can be called tasks.
* Tasks can be time planned, prioritized and sequenced or not.

## Efficiency principles
* Processing perfectly a task mean with the best exchange rate.
* Do whatever it takes to ensure the best efficiency.
 * Don’t let something take the control, have it.
 * Don’t stay in comfort zone, persist in front of obstacles.
 * See each little malfunction or process like something you can improve.
 * Be happy for quick wins and a slightly positive.
* Be concentrate, focus on actual process and make effort.
* Do your best, you are the last efficiency parameter.
