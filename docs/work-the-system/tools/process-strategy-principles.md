# Process strategy principles

This is a tool to optimally transform mixed strategy(process representation) parts into actions(process).

## Procedure
* [Objectives](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/blob/master/docs/work-the-system/definition/system-objectives.md) are made for a infinite term planning.
* [Strategies](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/tree/master/docs/work-the-system/strategies) are made for a long term planning and translated from objectives grouped by objectives.
* [Projects](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/projects) are made for a middle term planning from mixed strategy parts grouped by work type and strategies.
* [Tasks](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/issues) are made for a short term planning from mixed projects parts grouped by work type.

These point above are organized from very high level to very low level, as much a level is low as high process description is precise.

Organization principles are tools to write a textual representation of these process composed of informations that describe process procedure. Efficiency principles are tools to translate these textual representation of process into real mechanical and biological process.

As high the process description level is, as much it's representation is grouped by objectives, as low the process description level is, as much it's representation is grouped by process skills and type. This to minimize effort switching subject (objective) for a planning process and skills for a processing process. 

## Organization principles
* Output must justify input.
* Choose directive parts that is optimal to work on for the workday.
* To optimally choose what to work on use these principles above:
 * See thing with a cost-conscious driven mindset to minimize effort.
 * Do efficiency improvement process first to maximize exchange rate.
 * You can increase motivation by knowing doing actual optimal task to achieve the defined objective.
 * First things first by urgency then importance with knowing strategies deadlines.
* Directive parts chosen must be optimally transformed into sub-process.
* Sub-process can be time planned, prioritized and sequenced or not.

## Efficiency principles
* Processing perfectly a task mean with the best exchange rate.
* Do whatever it takes to ensure the best efficiency.
 * Don’t let something take the control, have it.
 * Don’t stay in comfort zone, persist in front of obstacles.
 * See each little malfunction or process like something you can improve.
 * Be happy for quick wins and a slightly positive.
* Be concentrate, focus on actual process and make effort.
* Don't wait on other process or process quality.
* Do your best, trust you, you are the last efficiency parameter.
