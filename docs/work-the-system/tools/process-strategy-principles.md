# Process strategy principles
This is an optional tool to improve your your effiency, use it only if you like it.

## Introduction

This document is a personal framework to **day-to-day** optimally transform strategy into actions.

Before starting to work **choose optimal strategies parts** you want to work on and transform them into sub-process (tasks).

During the work time **process sub-process chosen efficiently** by being in good body and mind conditions.

## Organization principles
* Choose directive parts that is optimal to work on for the workday.
* To optimally choose what to work on use these principles above:
 * See thing with a cost-conscious driven mindset to minimize effort.
 * Do efficiency improvement process first to maximize exchange rate.
 * You can increase motivation by knowing doing actual optimal task to achieve the goal.
 * First things first by urgency then importance with knowing strategies deadlines.
* Directive parts chosen must be optimally transformed into sub-process that can be called tasks.
* Tasks can be time planned, prioritized and sequenced or not.

## Efficiency principles
* Processing perfectly a task mean with the best exchange rate.
* Do whatever it takes to ensure the best efficiency.
 * Don’t let something take the control, have it.
 * Don’t stay in comfort zone, persist in front of obstacles.
 * See each little malfunction like something to improve.
 * Be happy for quick wins and slightly positive.
* Focus on actual process and make effort.
* Do your best, you are the last efficiency parameter.
