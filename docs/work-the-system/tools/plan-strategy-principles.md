# Plan strategy principles
This is a tool to plan optimal strategies in order to reach objectives.
It can be applied to any strategy type (optimization or developement).

## Introduction

An optimal strategy is a strategy that take less efforts to accomplish an objective.

* Strategy must be realist and composed of directives that can be nested.
* Directives must be optimally allocated along the path to achieve an objective.

## Principles

Principles are tools to efficiently define strategies.

* Strategy must be clear, as simple as possible and up-to-date.
* Strategy provide solid lines, thus draw an exact status of where things stand.
* Think freshly from scratch knowing all actual parameters that matter for objective.
* Think the simplest way with a effort-conscious mindset to accomplish objective.
* Know what is optimal and what is not.
* Focus on sustainable effort management, effort reduction and investment.
* Feed-back strategy optimization and check if it is realistic.
* When strategy obstacles occurs there are gifts to perfect it.

## Words explanation

 * Optimally allocated = not too much to loose effort re-planning because of unknown events and not too less to loose effort asking too much "what is that fuck ?".
 * Optimal = get suitable output with minimal given input.
   * Output = results.
   * Input = Time * effort.
   
Optimal = best exchange rate = max (Output / Input).
