Working similary as the way that for some people the number "13" is a lucky or bad lucky one according to their beleving can modify their organization and process in order to make what they beleive more likely to be true.

It's possible to use this trick in order to influance other organization level efficiency and by that way process.

More precisely, thinking that a [X = strategy, objective, project, task ...] will be [Y = applied, achieved, done, planned efficiently, ...] [Z = fast, efficiently, ...] can influance and make it easier with the "multiplication" of effort given to achieve the desired output.

## Principles

It exist a bunch of way to apply this trick, most often used are described above:

* Mentaly think some times that "I think that X will be Y Z".
* Write some times in a paper that "I think that X will be Y Z" (Better efficiently before sleeping).

Doing this not intensively but regulary improve above efficiently.

Note: Meditation can improve above efficiently.
