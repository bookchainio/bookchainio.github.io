# Mindset positioning organization

This concern the growth and fixed mindset & the extrinsic and intrinsic motivation.

This in the way to optimze efficently.

## introduction

## Fixed mindset & Growth mindset:

Trough fixed mindset result is the output not improvment, so improvement is emotion energy wasting and effort are placed in what is not optimal to place them. This is more likely to impsoe limit or generate frustration and emotion energy wasting trough an undesired output.

Trough growth mindset, result is not the output but improvment so improvment is much less emotion energy wasting and effort can be placed optimally in taking what is good to take in the inside and outside paramters and just do the best possible considering actual paramters. It unlock possibilites, improve efficently and low emotion energy wast.

## Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation

Similar as fixed mindset & growth mindset, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation are just the way that intention is optimally invested in action.

In an extrisec motivation effort are wasting doing not optimal stuff and invested in many different paths because of irregular and inadapted output based motivation.

In an intrinsic motivation effort are directly invested from passion invested in a regular stable set of actions that can be called a path in order to achieve a truly desired and nerly unique output.
