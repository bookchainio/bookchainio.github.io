# Mindset positioning organization [Pre-alpha]

This concern the growth and fixed mindset & the extrinsic and intrinsic motivation.

This in the way to optimize efficently.

## introduction

## Fixed & Growth mindset:

Trough fixed mindset result is the output not improvment, so improvement is emotion energy wasting and effort are placed in what is not optimal to place them. This is more likely to impsoe limit or generate frustration and emotion energy wasting trough an undesired output.

Trough growth mindset, result is not the output but improvment so improvment is much less emotion energy wasting and effort can be placed optimally in taking what is good to take in the inside and outside paramters and just do the best possible considering actual paramters. It unlock possibilites, improve efficently and low emotion energy wast.

## Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation

Similar as fixed mindset & growth mindset, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation are just the way that intention is optimally invested in action.

Trough an extrisec motivation effort are wasting doing not optimal stuff and invested in many different paths because of irregular and inadapted output based motivation.

Trough an intrinsic motivation effort are directly invested from passion invested in a regular stable set of actions that can be called a path in order to achieve a truly desired and nerly unique output.

## Conclusion

Growth mindset and intrinsic motivation are liked and provide a better effort management less bad emotion wasting and significantly unlock possibilities and improve effiently trough a self trustable, passion and positive way to handle input and provide a suitable output without being frustrated or limited but by being happy to know that improvment is nearly optimal, feeling of doing a great job come as fear and frustion disapears.
