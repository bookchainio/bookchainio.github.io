###Suggestions

The Esteem8 application project is meant to evolve with feedback.

The project team and users will greatly appreciate any thoughts on ways to improve the design or features.
To purpose any thoughts:

* For application code -> Use [Issues on github](https://github.com/esteem8app/esteem8app.github.io/issues) with the `enhancement` tag.
* For application features -> Use [Google forms](https://goo.gl/6a99QQ).
* For application new features -> Use the official Esteem8 new features steem publication.

###Bugs

As with all pieces of software, you may end up running into bugs. Please submit bugs as regular issues on GitHub.
Esteem8 developpers are regularly monitoring issues and will try to fix open bugs quickly.
The best bug reports include a detailed way to predictably reproduce the issue, and an example that demonstrates the issue.
