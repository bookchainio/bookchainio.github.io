# Project improve animation

[Very low priority]

## Strategy
* Look for animations inspirations
* Implement animations that do not decrease performances

## Comments
@Primerz think that the select tag dialog can be simulated tranformed from the dark toolbar in page explore. (With the polymer neon animation component)

@primerz think that a username text animation on drawer like in mkdocs material can be great
